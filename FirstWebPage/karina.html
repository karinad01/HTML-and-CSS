      <p class="name">Hi. My name is Karina Doynova and I am interested in developing. I am learning java right now and
        in
        my free time
        I make researches and
        try to create websites by using the technologies HTML and CSS. As I am new in this adventure, I invite you to
        join me, if you are also
        as motivated as I am. I want to improve my knowledge and create more and more... So without further hesitation,
        just text me
       (You will find a contact form bellow.)

      <p class="moreinfo1">You already know, that I love programming. But some more information about me is that I also
        love nature. Yes,
        there is nothing
        between programming and nature. But the thing, that I love the most is the nature and I love spending time
        listening to the songs
        of the birds, or walking and just seing all around me. This gives me the motivaiton I need to go on and to be
        motivated all the time.

    I really love birds. I have a pet since I was 7. She learned me that the small things in life
    really matter. She
    was a parrot.
    Since then I love parrots and now I have also a parrot, called Rikkie (Phyrrhura Molinae). My interests in pets
    and nature made me
    create my youtube channel "Pernati BG". You can check it out by the way here: <a
      href=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDZ6-26Fq8eKQE8ZcmBOfDw> Pernati BG</a>,
    where I give the people advices how to take care for a parrots and pets at all. My channel is really helpful for
    those, who have no or a little
    experience with pets.
